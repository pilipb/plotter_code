# Step by step walk through

## Step 1: load image

## Step 2: scale down to number of rows = lines drawn

## Step 3: convert to grayscale

## Step 4: for each pixel row, find starting position (as mid point of pixel height)

## Step 5: for each pixel row, draw horizontal line from starting position to end of row

## Step 6: make each line a sine wave

## Step 7: change amplitude of sine wave based on pixel brightness for each pixel 

## Step 8: change frequency of sine wave based on pixel brightness for each pixel
        note that the step size is the same for each pixel, but the frequency is different

## Step 9: connect end of each line to start of next line

# Step 10: save image
